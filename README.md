# Business Problem:
######  An e-commerce company wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies based on these segments.

# Dataset Story:
###### The dataset named "Online Retail II" contains sales data of an online retail store based in the United Kingdom between 01/12/2009 - 09/12/2011.

# Variables:
##### InvoiceNo: Invoice number. A unique number for each transaction or invoice. If it starts with C, it indicates a canceled transaction.
##### StockCode: Product code. A unique number for each product.
##### Description: Product name.
##### Quantity: Product quantity. Indicates how many of the products in the invoices were sold.
##### InvoiceDate: Invoice date and time.
##### UnitPrice: Product price (in pounds).
##### CustomerID: Unique customer number.
##### Country: Country name. The country where the customer lives.

# RFM 
###### RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is a method of customer segmentation based on their transaction history.
###### Recency refers to how recently a customer has made a purchase, with more recent purchases indicating higher engagement with the brand.
###### Frequency measures how often a customer has made purchases, with more frequent purchases indicating a higher level of loyalty.
###### Monetary measures the amount of money a customer has spent on purchases, with higher monetary values indicating a higher lifetime value for the customer.
###### Using these three metrics, customers can be segmented into different groups, allowing for targeted marketing efforts and personalized communication strategies
# K-Means
###### K-Means segmentation is a popular clustering algorithm used for customer segmentation in marketing. The algorithm groups customers together based on similarities in their characteristics and behavior.
###### The algorithm works by first selecting a number of clusters (k) and then assigning each customer to the closest cluster based on their attributes. The algorithm then calculates the mean of each cluster and re-assigns each customer to the closest cluster based on the updated mean. This process continues until the clusters no longer change significantly.
###### K-Means segmentation is widely used for customer segmentation in marketing as it allows companies to understand the needs and behavior of their customers, and create targeted marketing campaigns to specific groups based on their characteristics and preferences.
